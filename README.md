# Handmade Hero OSX Platform Layer Tutorials


## What is it?
This is a code repository designed to accompany my [Medium series on setting up an OSX platform layer for Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero project](https://medium.com/@theobendixson/handmade-hero-osx-platform-layer-day-1-9348559e9211).

I plan to follow the series, making articles and videos as if Casey had started development on a Mac instead of a P.C. My goal is to make it easier for Mac users to learn from Handmade Hero without having to go buy a P.C. just to start in.

Eventually, this series will find its natural end and (I hope) seamlessly tie into the rest of the [Handmade Hero series](https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive). Once most of the work in the initial platform layer is complete, and the tutorials spend the majority of their time in the game's cross-platform C++ source code, I will consider my job done and probably go drink a beer or take a few laps through the terrain park.

## How is it organized?
As I follow each day, I plan to commit the source code to folders named after each day in the series. 

My articles and videos will follow Casey's content as closely as possible. That means what you see in the Day 1 folder will be the Mac OS equivalent of what Casey did on Windows on Day 1, and so on throughout the series.

## A note on intellectual property
I will make sure none not to commit any of the game's original source code to this repository.

If a particular day has some part that references the cross-platform c++ code from the game, I'll simply make a note of it in that folder and tell you to go [preorder Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org) so you can use Casey's code.

I really want you to [support Casey's work by going and preordering the game](https://handmadehero.org). He is doing a remarkable service to the community, offering a kind of education that is pretty much impossible to find anywhere else.

## Acknowledgements
Many of the ideas employed in this series and code repository come from [Jeff Buck's Handmade Hero OSX port](https://github.com/itfrombit/osx_handmade). Not much of what I'm doing is all that original. I'm playing the messenger and distilling what he's done into a series that is easy to follow for beginners.

Jeff's code is great if you want to dive right into this project and figure it for yourself. I can't say when I'll have all of the tutorials finished, so if you want to see what this will probably look like when it's all done, it's a fantastic resource.

And of course, many thanks to Casey for opening my mind to a new way to build apps and games.
